Looking at #makeovermonday 2019w16: word use in the â€˜Info we Trustâ€™ book by RJ Andrews

[First published on The Data School Blog.]({{page.external_url}}){:target="\_blank"}

<!--more-->

<p>After a bit of a break (I still haven&#8217;t finished my 2019w15 Makeover Monday, but don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m getting there), I&#8217;m back with my blogs.</p>

<p>This week focuses on the words used in the <em><a href="https://infowetrust.com/inspire/">InfoÂ weÂ Trust</a></em><a href="https://infowetrust.com/inspire/"> by RJ Andrews</a>. The original visualisation is shown below:</p>

<h3>What doesn&#8217;t work?</h3>

<p>First of all, I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;m looking at. It is a word cloud, fine, but I don&#8217;t know where do the words come from. What are they representing? I simply don&#8217;t know. </p>

<p>Another thing is the colours. Just too many. Way too many.</p>

<h3>What does work?</h3>

<p>Even though a word cloud may not be the best chart type, it is quite intuitive. The fact that <em>data</em> is by far the biggest and in the horizontal orientation is helping focus the attention.</p>

<h3>How can I improve it?</h3>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d definitely want to add some information, at least where is the data coming from and what is the viz showing. I&#8217;m not convinced using all of the words is the best idea since some are barely noticeable and just add clutter without adding extra information.</p>

<p>Below you can see my makeover:</p>

<p>In here, I focused on the top 10 words by count and their use throughout the book. During our Makeover Monday session in the Data School, <a href="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/blog/robert-headington/">Robert</a> had pointed out that some of the sections are longer than others. To accommodate for this I just wrote an LOD that calculated word count per page. This allowed comparing the word concentration in different sections of the book. (If you don&#8217;t know what LODs are or just want some extra clarification, stay tuned because I&#8217;ll be writing a blog post on it very soon!)</p>

<p>In my viz I also incorporated the colours of the book itself which is always a nice touch:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it from me for now. It seems that I&#8217;m catching up with my blog posts so expect more content soon ðŸ™‚</p>
