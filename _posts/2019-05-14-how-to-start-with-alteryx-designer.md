<p>A few people have asked me how to start their journey with Alteryx and so I decided to write down what I know so it&#8217;s easier to pass the information.</p>

<div style="height:23px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>First of all, there are a few different products that <a href="https://www.alteryx.com/platform">Alteryx</a> offers. Assuming you&#8217;re new to the platform, you&#8217;re very likely to start with <a href="https://www.alteryx.com/products/alteryx-platform/alteryx-designer">Alteryx Designer</a>. It&#8217;s a program that allows you to prepare and analyse data in various ways, from simple operations to spatial and predictive analytics. This is what I&#8217;ll focus on in this post and will refer to it as Alteryx.</p>

<h3>How to get your hands on Alteryx?</h3>

<p>One way to start using Alteryx is to get a 14-day trial version, that you can download <a href="https://www.alteryx.com/designer-trial/free-trial">here</a>. To continue after the trial ends, you will need to get a <a href="https://www.alteryx.com/products/platform-details/pricing">license</a>.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<h3>Where do I start?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re London-based, I highly recommend The Information Lab&#8217;s Alteryx Designer Essentials courses. It&#8217;s a great way to learn how Alteryx works and how to build workflows, all through hands-on exercises. The courses are free of charge and run regularly. You can find out the times on our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lets-talk-Data/events/">meetup page</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not London-based, don&#8217;t worry, there are other resources you can use. <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/">Alteryx Community</a> is a great place to learn about Alteryx: it has blogs, forums, its own <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Overview/bd-p/academy-overview">Academy</a> web page. In other words, plenty of resources. From the Academy Overview, you can access <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Interactive-Lessons/tkb-p/interactive-lessons">Interactive Lessons</a> and <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Live-Training/bd-p/live-training">Live Training</a> sessions. </p>

<h3>What next?</h3>

<h4>Weekly Challenges</h4>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve got the basics, <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenge/Weekly-Challenge-Index-amp-Welcome/td-p/48275">Weekly Challenges</a> are a fantastic way to improve your skills and learn new tools. The idea is to create a workflow that will transform the input data into the desired output. The challenges have varied difficulty and topics so you can easily find something to put your skills to practice.</p>

<p>Once you have a solution, comment on the post and add the workflow as an attachment &#8211; this is how you get the badges! You can also see what the original solution was and what others have done to get the same response. A really good way to learn Alteryx as it gives you plenty of different use cases.</p>

<h4>Alteryx Certified</h4>

<p>Another good way to learn about the tools is to take the <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Certification/bd-p/product-certification">Alteryx Certification</a> exams. First, you need to take the <a href="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/hanna-nykowska/alteryx-certification-designer-core-exam/">Core Exam</a>, then you can continue with the <a href="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/hanna-nykowska/alteryx-certification-designer-advanced-exam/">Advanced Exam</a>. You can take them as many times as you want (with 7 days between the attempts) and they are free of charge.</p>

<h4>Personal Projects</h4>

<p>The best way to practice though is to find a project, something you are personally interested in.  <a href="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/blog/">The Data School Blog</a> might come in handy when you search for solutions to specific problems you&#8217;re running into. The trick is not to give up ðŸ˜‰</p>
