<p>There were a few blog posts on dealing with colours in Tableau, but how can you use the saved colour palettes without picking the screen colour or copying the hex codes? Keep on reading.</p>

<p>Whenever you want to change a colour of the marks but you don&#8217;t have any field on the colour, this is what you end up with:</p>

<p>If you click on More colors&#8230; you will see a colour picker (1):</p>

<p>not a list of custom colour palettes (2):</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2019/05/image-86.png" alt="" class="wp-image-26949" width="334" height="272" srcset="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2019/05/image-86.png 498w, https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2019/05/image-86-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /></figure>

<p>So how do you go from (1) to (2)?</p>

<h4>1. Create a dummy field</h4>

<p>You can either create an ad-hoc calculation on the marks card. Double-click on the empty space on the Marks card and just type in:</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>''</code></pre>

<p>This will automatically assign it to detail.</p>

<p>The alternative is to create a calculated field, call it whatever you like (eg. Dummy) and type in as above.</p>

<h4>2. Put the dummy field on Color</h4>

<p>Whichever method you&#8217;re using (ad-hoc or saved calculation), drag it onto Color.</p>

<h4>3. Choose a colour from a colour palette</h4>

<p>Now, you can go to Color -&gt; Edit Colors and you end up with (2)!</p>

<h4>Caveats</h4>

<p>There&#8217;s something to have in mind, whenever you&#8217;re using an ad-hoc calculations with colours, the colour palette will default to automatic palette when uploaded on Server. The walkaround is to save the calculation and problem solved ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>For continuous options (don&#8217;t know why would you want that), use <strong>0</strong> instead of <strong>&#8221;</strong>.</p>
