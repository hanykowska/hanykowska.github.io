Short summary of Alteryx Designer Core Exam from my perspective and what helped me pass it.

<p>Hi everyone! Those of you familiar with my blog posts on my Alteryx Challenge (which is to finish all Alteryx Weekly Challenges by the end of the DS training, read <a href="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/hanna-nykowska/week-1-done-15-more-to-go/">this</a> to get familiar with the idea), may know that I&#8217;ve had some experience with Alteryx. That is if you count finishing 40+ challenges as experience ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/blog/jonathan-allenby/">Jon</a> reminded our cohort to register for Alteryx Designer Core Exam so that we could take it in March. And so we did. I decided to have a casual go at the exam over the weekend which turned into two hours of hard work and I actually <a href="https://twitter.com/hanykowska/status/1102139928090152960">passed it</a>! (With 92.9% score, I didn&#8217;t actually expect it during the exam so I&#8217;m quite pleased)</p>

<h3>The Certification</h3>

<p>The Alteryx Designer Core Exam is part of <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Certification/bd-p/product-certification">Community Certification</a> and it&#8217;s the first step. The next certificate is Alteryx Designer Advanced. These two are free of charge and you have to pass Core first to go on with Advanced.</p>

<p>Once you register for the exam (Register button on Alteryx Designer Core panel), you&#8217;ll get a confirmation email. The exam will be available for you from the 1st of the next calendar month and you&#8217;ll have three tries to pass within that month. Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t manage it, you can register for the next month as well.</p>

<p>The Core exam has to be finished within one sitting and is time-limited to 2h. There are 80 questions about various tools and the Designer itself.</p>

<p>Once finished, you&#8217;ll see your result straight away and will get a confirmation email. I had to wait a few hours to get the email with the certificate so don&#8217;t stress out if you don&#8217;t get it immediately.</p>

<h3>The Preparation</h3>

<p>If you want to take steps to prepare for the exam, check out the <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ayx.policies/Core+Certification+Exam+Prep+Guide.pdf">Prep Guide</a>. It has information about the exam itself, the curriculum and some mock questions. I went through the content of the exam and decided I know enough. Then I did the mock questions that felt alright so I thought to give it a go.</p>

<p>Another option is to do some <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenge/Weekly-Challenge-Index-amp-Welcome/td-p/48275">Weekly Challenges</a>, this should get you fairly familiar with Alteryx. Doing the challenges forces you to learn various tools which is quite good in this scenario.</p>

<h3>The Exam</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, I thought I&#8217;d have a casual go at the exam but that didn&#8217;t happen. I have actually found it more stressful than I anticipated and it seemed like there wasn&#8217;t too much time. The questions vary quite a lot, there is no order to them. Or at least it didn&#8217;t seem like there was any. </p>

<p>What helped me a lot was having Alteryx Designer open so that you can check the answers in the program itself. Sometimes the questions will be about the functionality of a tool. Sometimes you&#8217;ll be asked about the result for specific action on specific data. </p>

<p>The annoying bit is that the data is presented as an image so you can&#8217;t copy and paste, sadly. The good news is the data is so small you can easily and quickly type it into the text input tool. You&#8217;ll be also asked about results for some datasets that you&#8217;ll have to download on your machine.</p>

<p>Tip: you can drag and drop data files onto the canvas and it will be automatically imported. This should save you some time&#8230; (I was reminded of it during one of the question, which of course had to be towards the end of the exam&#8230;)</p>

<p>In the summary: have Alteryx open and do as much as you can in Alteryx to make sure your answers are correct.</p>

<p>If you have some experience with Alteryx, sign up and have a go. It&#8217;s free and you get many attempts at it, so no stress (unless you&#8217;re as competitive as I am). It&#8217;s also a good learning experience because you get to test many different functionalities of various tools.</p>
