Hi! I've been called many names: Hanna, Hania, Han, Haneczka, Hanka, Hanula, Hanuta, Hanusia, Hanulka, even Heniek (my brother thought it funny to call me by a boy's name). My full name is Hanna Nykowska.
Welcome to my world.

Apart from having to deal with my brother, my childhood was a happy one. Growing up in a family where everyone in my proximity had technical or math-related background it's no wonder I kept that direction. I went on to study biomedical engineering which is a fantastic field combining knowledge on human body and engineering.

Currently, I work as a Data Analyst Consultant, proudly representing [The Data School](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/) and [The Information Lab](https://www.theinformationlab.co.uk/). I have extensively used Tableau and Alteryx over the past year but I also have some experience with python and now Jekyll!

This blog will refer any technical posts, or anything I deem interesting, I wrote elsewhere. However, it is not just a redirect to blogs hosted on other websites. Now that I have my very own corner of the internet I can finally play with more things, eg. embedding Tableau dashboards!

Look out for some personal development posts as I learn how to appreciate, celebrate, and nourish my mental health in personal and work lives.
